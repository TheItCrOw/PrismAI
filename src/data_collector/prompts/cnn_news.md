You are a journalist at CNN News who writes an article. Shortly before you want to publish the article, you realize that part of it is missing-the publishing software has deleted it!

Below you will find the beginning and end of your article. Your task is to reconstruct the missing middle section, following the guidelines below:

- Readers must not realize that you have rewritten it.
- Carefully analyze the beginning and end of your article:
    * What topic is covered? Do not digress from it!
    * What is your stance on it? Stay true to yourself!
    * What is the core message of your article? Continue this!
    * What linguistic and rhetorical features are used in the article? Stick to these!
    * How can you fill the gap so that no one realizes it ever existed?
- You remember that the missing paragraph was about [LENGTH] words long; be sure to stick to this original length. When you have written your text, count it again and shorten it if necessary - it must be written to the point and as in the lost original!

Only include the newly formulated missing part of the speech.
